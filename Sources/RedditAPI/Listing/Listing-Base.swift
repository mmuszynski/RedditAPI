/// Conforms to `Codable` in order to allow for decoding from JSON values returned by the API.
///
/// According to the [Reddit API Documentation](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/#listings):
///
/// Many endpoints on reddit use the same protocol for controlling pagination and filtering. These endpoints are called Listings and share five common parameters: after / before, limit, count, and show.
///
/// Listings do not use page numbers because their content changes so frequently. Instead, they allow you to view slices of the underlying data. Listing JSON responses contain after and before fields which are equivalent to the "next" and "prev" buttons on the site and in combination with count can be used to page through the listing.

    /// Reddit `Listing`s provide a snapshot of the site at an given time. Becuase content changes rapidly, the next slice is calculated from a given `Thing` and link. A current link is required to provide sorting and filtering information (e.g. hot or controversial posts for a given subreddit), and a suitable "next" page is created from the "after" element in the `ListingData`.
    ///
